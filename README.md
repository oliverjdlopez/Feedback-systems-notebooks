This is a selection of weekly assignments I wrote for the PhD course CS 6784, Machine Learning in Feedback Systems. I chose these particular assignments because they include some nice visualizations. All code in these notebooks was written solely by me, with references as described below.


state_estimation.ipynb is an investigation of different state estimation methods under noisy system dynamics and measurement. Both stackelberg_risk.ipynb and finiteLDS_identification.ipynb are extensions of research papers. finiteLDS.ipynb is motivated by a paper by Recht and Tu, while stackelberg_risk.ipynb is based off Zrnic et al.



Papers:
Stephen Tu and Benjamin Recht. The gap between model-based and model-free methods on the linear quadratic regulator: An asymptotic viewpoint. 2019.
Tijana Zrnic, Eric Mazumdar, Shankar Sastry, and Michael Jordan. Who leads and who follows in strategic classification? 2021.
